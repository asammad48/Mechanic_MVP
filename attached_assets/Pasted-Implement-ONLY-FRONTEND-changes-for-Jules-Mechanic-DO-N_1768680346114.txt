Implement ONLY FRONTEND changes for Jules Mechanic.
DO NOT touch backend.
DO NOT touch database or Prisma.
DO NOT refactor API contracts.
Assume backend APIs already exist and return correct data.

Tech stack:
- React + Vite
- Existing component structure must be preserved
- Follow current UI style and layout conventions

========================
FRONTEND SCOPE (VISIT DETAILS)
========================

We need to extend the Visit Details UI to support:
1) Labor (per hour)
2) Spare parts
3) Outside workshop (outsourced) work
4) Mandatory visit field enforcement (UI-level)

========================
1) LABOR SECTION (PER HOUR)
========================
In the Visit Details panel:

- Add a “Labor” section
- Add a form with fields:
  - Title (text, required)
  - Hours (number, decimal allowed e.g. 1.5, required)
  - Rate per hour (number, required)

Behavior:
- On submit → call existing backend endpoint
- Do NOT calculate totals on frontend
- Display returned labor items in a table/list:
  - Title
  - Hours
  - Rate/hour
  - Subtotal (from backend)
- Show a “Labor Subtotal” value (from backend visit totals)

========================
2) SPARE PARTS SECTION
========================
In the Visit Details panel:

- Add a “Spare Parts” section
- Add a form with fields:
  - Part name (required)
  - Quantity (required)
  - Unit price (required)

Behavior:
- Submit → backend
- Display parts list:
  - Name
  - Qty
  - Unit price
  - Subtotal (from backend)
- Show “Parts Subtotal” (from backend)

========================
3) OUTSIDE WORKSHOP WORK (NEW UI SECTION)
========================
Add a NEW section titled:
“Outside Workshop / Outsourced Work”

Form fields:
- Vendor name (required)
- Work description (required)
- Cost (required)
- Notes (optional)

Behavior:
- Submit → backend
- Display list of outside work items:
  - Vendor
  - Description
  - Cost
- Show “Outside Work Subtotal” (from backend)

========================
4) TOTALS PANEL (READ-ONLY)
========================
Add a clear totals summary panel in Visit Details:

Display (read-only):
- Subtotal Labor
- Subtotal Parts
- Subtotal Outside Work
- Grand Total
- Paid Amount
- Due Amount

Rules:
- Values must come from backend response
- Frontend must NOT compute totals
- Update UI after any add/delete action

========================
5) MANDATORY FIELD ENFORCEMENT (UI ONLY)
========================
In “New Car Entry” modal:
- Mark required fields visually:
  - Complaint
  - Mileage
  - Registration number
  - Customer phone OR name
- Disable submit button if required fields missing
- Display backend validation errors clearly if returned

========================
6) UX / UI RULES
========================
- Keep layout consistent with existing dashboard
- Use cards/sections with clear headings
- Use tables or stacked lists (mobile-friendly)
- Show proper empty states:
  - “No labor added yet”
  - “No parts added”
  - “No outside work recorded”

========================
TESTING / VERIFICATION
========================
- Do NOT write automated tests
- Manually verify in browser:
  - Forms submit correctly
  - Lists update after actions
  - Totals update when backend responds
  - No console errors

========================
DELIVERABLE
========================
- Updated React components only
- No backend or DB changes
- Build runs without errors
- Clean, usable Visit Details UI
